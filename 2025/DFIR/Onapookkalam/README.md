# Onapookkalam / ഓണപ്പൂക്കളം

I took down some important notes on my phone before I went to prepare my pookkalam. Help me find out what I had written down. Also i saw somebody mess with my phone while i was outside. I fear someone might have deleted or modified some of my important data. While you are there, can you also *access my data* and figure out what was deleted?

`flagPart1` -> from my forgotten notes

`flagPart2` -> string which was modified and then deleted from the realm db

Format: `bi0s{flagPart1_flagPart2}`
