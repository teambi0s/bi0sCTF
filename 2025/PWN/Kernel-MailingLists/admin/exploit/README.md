### Compilation Commands 

```
musl-gcc -static -fno-stack-protector exploit.c -o exploit
```

Using musl for reduced size of the binary

### Exploit Reliability :

The reliability of the exploit is as good as the reliability of the first half which is the splitting of the order 3 pages into multiple order 2 and order 1 and order 0 pages. In my local device it has around 50% reliability. i could not completely implement the rotation of the lists, with that it would be having even better odds.


### Unintended Solves :

A bug in close() of the module gives you a UAF primitive that you can use to write data using increments of mail counts or public_key field based writes.

### Intended bug : 

The bug is in the broadcast mail unlinking functionality which accidentally ends up being the same as the fifo functionality which is shwon in regular mails.
