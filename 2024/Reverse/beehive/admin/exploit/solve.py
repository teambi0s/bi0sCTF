# the array given for comparison can be easily found from the challenge on any decompiler 
# like IDA PRO or Ghidra

# The array is:
array = [86, 174, 206, 236, 250, 44, 118, 246, 46, 22, 204, 78, 250, 174, 206, 204, 78, 118, 44, 182, 166, 2, 70, 150, 12, 206, 116, 150, 118]

# the challenge is simply taking each byte of your input, flipping the bits 
# in an 8-bit fashion, then converting them back to integers and comparing 
# it with this array


# let's do the reverse of that 
array = ['{:08b}'.format(i) for i in array]
array = [int(i[::-1], 2) for i in array]
array = [chr(i) for i in array]
print(''.join(array))

# the output is:
# jus7_4noth3r_us3rn4me@bi0s.in
